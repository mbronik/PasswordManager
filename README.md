### Password Manager

This is a console application which lets you store passwords.

You choose an encrypted text file with passwords, then you input a "master password" to this file. If the master password is wrong, the file gets corrupted and is unrecoverable.

You can sort, add, edit and remove passwords from the file.

File: data.txt

Password: admin
